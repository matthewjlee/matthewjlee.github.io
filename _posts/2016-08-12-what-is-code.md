I've taken only two courses in computer science, _Intro to Java_ and _Intermediate Programming_, a nasty and difficult introductory course that teaches C/C++. Even after _Intermediate Programming_ aggresively shoved a semester's worth of material into my brain in just five weeks, I still find myself scratching the door of what I can actually do using computer science. I also find myself often thinking about if what I'm learning in class really matters.   
I don't know a lot, and I __really__ worry about that. So, in order to combat this pesky anxiety that I have, I'm going to start documenting the things that I'll be learning on my own right here on my blog. I encourage you all to follow me on my journey of learning how to make code that actually matters in the real world. My goal is to be ready for industry in one year's time.  
I have no idea if my skillset will change, evolve, or completely regress. Regardless of what happens, this blog will show me if anything has changed at all.

In total, I have taken only two courses in computer programming. I took _Introduction to Java_ and _Intermediate Programming_, a class where all Hopkins CS majors first learn the basics of C and C++. Even though I learned a lot from those classes (especially during _Intermediate!), I still find myself only scratching the door of what I can potentially do with computer science.

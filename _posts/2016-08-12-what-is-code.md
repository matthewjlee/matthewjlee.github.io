I have taken only two courses in computer science, _Intro to Java_ and _Intermediate Programming_, an intro course that teaches C/C++. Even after __Intermediate Programming__ aggresively shoved a semester's worth of material into my brain in just five weeks, I still find myself scratching the door of what I can actually do using computer science. And, I also find myself thinking about if what I'm learning in class really matters.   
I really don't know a lot, and I __really__ worry about that. So, in order to combat this pesky anxiety I have, I'm going to start documenting the things that I'm learning on my own right here on my blog. I encourage you all to follow me on my journey of learning how to make code that actually matters in the real world. My goal is to be ready for industry in one year's time from now.  
I have no idea if my skillset will change, evolve, or completely regress. Regardless of what happens, this blog will show me if anything has changed at all.

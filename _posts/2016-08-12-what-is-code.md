In total, I have taken only two courses in computer science, _Intro to Java_ and _Intermediate Programming_, an intro course that teaches C/C++. Even after I shoved a semester's worth of material into five intensive weeks into my brain, I still found myself scratching the door of what I can potentially accomplish utilizing computer science. Rather, I thought more about how I can establish a more useful skillset to impact the issues that I actually care about.  
I really don't know a lot, and I __really__ worry about that. So, in order to combat this pesky anxiety I have, I'm going to start documenting the things that I'm learning on my own right here on my blog. I encourage you all to follow me on my journey of learning how to make code that actually matters in the real world. My goal is to be ready for industry in one year's time from now.  
I have no idea if my skillset will change, evolve, or completely regress. Regardless of what happens, this blog will show me if anything has changed at all.

# matthewjlee.github.io
a website for my stuffs.

i actually deployed this using s3 and route53! check out matthewjunelee.com for some shenanigans.
learnt some things along the way:
- a dev and prod webpack setup (basic build system stuff)
- serving content via S3, route53, and cloudfront along with security certificates. 
- some react and css shenanigans
